# Datasheet for Body Measurements Dataset

## 1. Motivation

- **Purpose**: This dataset was created to support machine learning research in body classification, health analytics, biometric modeling, and clothing size prediction.
- **Intended Tasks**: Classification tasks (e.g., gender prediction), regression tasks (e.g., height, age estimation), and exploratory body feature modeling.
- **Creators**: The dataset was uploaded to Kaggle by Saurabh Shahane. There is no affiliation explicitly stated.
- **Funding**: No formal funding disclosed on Kaggle.

## 2. Composition

- **Instances Represented**: Each row in the dataset represents a single individual described by 13 body measurement attributes.
- **Number of Instances**: 716 individuals.
- **Sampling Method**: Not disclosed.
- **Representativeness**: Dataset includes both males (391) and females (324); ethnic or geographic diversity is not mentioned.
- **Data Types**:
  - Gender (M=1, F=2)
  - Age (1 year and above)
  - HeadCircumference
  - ShoulderWidth
  - ChestWidth
  - Belly
  - Waist
  - Hips
  - ArmLength
  - ShoulderToWaist
  - WaistToKnee
  - LegLength
  - TotalHeight (Head to toe)
- All measurements are in inches.
- **Label**: No specific target label defined; dataset is open to exploratory modeling.
- **Missing Data**: None reported.
- **Confidential or Sensitive Data**: Dataset appears anonymized and does not include any direct identifiers.

## 3. Collection Process

- **How Was Data Collected?**: Not specified. Likely via manual measurement from subjects.
- **Sampling Strategy**: Not disclosed.
- **Timeframe**: Unknown.

## 4. Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling

- **Preprocessing Done**: Data appears clean and numeric with no missing values.
- **Raw Data Availability**: No indication of whether raw unprocessed data was saved.

## 5. Uses

- **Intended Uses**: Predictive modeling, health analytics, biometric modeling, clothing fit prediction.
- **Other Potential Uses**: Ergonomics, fitness, child growth analysis.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Avoid misuse for discriminatory profiling; ensure fairness in health-related applications.
- **Tasks It Should Not Be Used For**: Critical medical diagnostics or policy decisions without extensive validation.

## 6. Distribution
